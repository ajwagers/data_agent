# data_agent
A Pandas Data Agent using a remotely hosted LLM to chat about data sets.

I started with the Iris dataset, hardcoded into the program but plan to make it so the user can select data to add to the chat.
I am struggling to get the Ollama API and/or the Open-WebUI API to work right, I am attempting to use, not the localhost, but another instance hosted on another computer on my network.

This work was inspired by [pandas-dataframe-agent](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/youtube-tutorials/tree/main/pandas-dataframe-agent)
